English Premier League Match Winner Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the winner of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL) using machine learning techniques in Python. By analyzing historical match data, we aim to build an accurate predictive model.

Key steps include:
	•	Scraping match data using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.
	•	Cleaning and preprocessing the data with pandas for machine learning.
	•	Developing a predictive model using scikit-learn to determine match outcomes.
	•	Evaluating model performance and refining predictions to improve accuracy.

This project provides valuable insights into football match outcomes and explores data-driven approaches to sports analytics.
